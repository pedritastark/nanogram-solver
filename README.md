# nanogram-solver
Python project developed using propositional logic and SAT solvers to address problems that can be formulated through propositional logic, to a generalization of 5x5 nonograms.



#summary
The purpose of this project is to address and solve problems that can be formulated and resolved through a series of rules in propositional logic. The primary objective is to implement propositional logic within Python for solving a diverse array of problems. Specifically, this repository is dedicated to tackling a 5x5 nonogram. The chosen approach to solve it involves utilizing SAT solvers. The context of this project harkens back to one of my earliest Python endeavors during my university studies, completed as part of the "Logic for Computer Science
